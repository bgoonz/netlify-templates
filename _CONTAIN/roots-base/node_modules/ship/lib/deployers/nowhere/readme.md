Nowhere
-------

Potentially the most useful of the deployers we have, this one will deploy your files to absolutely nowhere. That's right - you can run this deployer all day long, but it's not going to send your files anywhere but where they already are.

Jokes aside, this is used mostly for testing and/or trolling rather than real deploys. So either ignore it or have some fun with it. You will see that the source code is rather straightforward.

### Config Values

**nothing**: set this to anything you want, it doesn't do anything anyway. but if you don't set it, you get an error. this makes sense, really.
